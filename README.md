This mod is based on [a suggestion by u/daXfactorz on reddit community r/minecraftsuggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/d6ff9a/brimstone_a_more_reliable_source_of_gunpowder_and/).

## What it adds

This mod adds sulfur, a highly volatile substance used for making gunpowder.

## Blocks and Items

### Sulfur Ore

Sulfur Ore is found in the nether with the same rarity and vein size as Nether Quartz. It drops 2-4 sulfur when mined.

If Sulfur Ore is destroyed by an explosion, it produces an explosion with slightly less power than a block of TNT per ore. Ghast fireballs destroy Sulfur Ore with one direct hit.

### Sulfur

Sulfur is dropped from Sulfur Ore and is a crafting component for gunpowder and Sulfur Blocks.

### Sulfur Block

Sulfur Blocks are highly flammable blocks crafted from Sulfur. If ignited with flint and steel or fire charges, all continuously adjacent Sulfur Blocks will immediately turn into fire.

## Recipes

### Gunpowder

Gunpowder can be crafted with one Sulfur and one coal or charcoal. The recipe is shapeless and yields two gunpowder.

### Sulfur Blocks

Sulfur Blocks are crafted with four Sulfur in a 2x2 grid.

### Sulfur

Sulfur Blocks can be crafted back into Sulfur by putting a single block anywhere in the crafting grid. The recipe yields four Sulfur.
