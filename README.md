## Blocks and Items

### Sulfur Ore

![Sulfur Ore](https://github.com/professorg/SulfurMod/raw/master/images/sulfurore.png)

Sulfur Ore is found in the nether with the same rarity and vein size as Nether Quartz. It drops 2-4 sulfur when mined.

If Sulfur Ore is destroyed by an explosion, it produces an explosion with slightly less power than a block of TNT per ore. Ghast fireballs destroy Sulfur Ore with one direct hit.

### Sulfur

Sulfur is dropped from Sulfur Ore and is a crafting component for gunpowder and Sulfur Blocks.

### Sulfur Block

Sulfur Blocks are highly flammable blocks crafted from Sulfur. If ignited with flint and steel or fire charges, all continuously adjacent Sulfur Blocks will immediately turn into fire.
